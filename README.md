**THIS PAGE IS A WIP!!!!**

**Goal:** We seek to define a minimal prose grammar which can be translated to a [categorical framework for knowledge representation (with HEAVY inspiration coming from Ologs)](https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf).

## The Challenge

According to [the Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prose), prose is defined as:
> the ordinary language people use in speaking or writing

Google/The Oxford English dictionary goes further and adds `without metrical structure`. Thus, normal prose is inherantly hard to programmatically structure (that is the basis of [NLP - Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), specifically I am interested in [Part of Speech Tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)).

However, that is simply "normal" prose. That is prose written by other people without any forethought about its eventual translation to a structured form. If we define a minimal subset of prose that is translatable to a defined structure, we may then consider how to expand upon the set of prose acceptable and translatable with the eventual goal of "normal-ish" prose such that arbitrary, intentionally constructed, notes can be formulated automatically into our KR framework.
